# DalliKlick

This is an implementation of the DalliKlick game for the Browser.

## How it works

Choose a folder containing images you want to play with.

These are the controlls:

- `spacebar` to start/pause automatically revealing parts of the image.
- `enter` reveal whole image at once
- `right arrow` manually reveal a random piece (this also pauses auto-reveal)
- if an image is completely revealed `right arrow` will move to the next image


I implemented this first in 2013 using a Chrome Extension. Since HTML5 APIs matured enough for this to work as a webpage, I put it up here.
